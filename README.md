# Computational Neuroscience Videos
This repository contains Manim-based videos on computational neuroscience. Producing these videos is part of the [NSF CAREER Award #2437304](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2437304&HistoricalAwards=false). The currently available short video is proof of the feasibility of the educational goals described in this proposal. 

The demo video is available on YouTube and in the `video` subdirectory of this project. The notebook with the code to produce this video is available at the root of the project.
