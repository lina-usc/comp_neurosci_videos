# Computational Neuroscience Videos
Manim-based videos on computational neuroscience. Producing these videos is part of a pending grant proposal. The currently available short video is proof of the feasibility of the educational goals described in this proposal. 

The demo video is available on YouTube and in the `video` subdirectory of this project. The notebook with the code to produce this video is available at the root of the project.
